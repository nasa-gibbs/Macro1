# Mathematics for Macroeconomics: Source Files

This repository contains the source files of the course "Mathematics for Macroeconomics" developed by [Pascal Michaillat](https://pascalmichaillat.org/) and taught at the [London School of Economics & Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk).

## Course webpage

The course material is hosted at https://pascalmichaillat.org/c3/.

## Course overview

The course is designed for graduate students. It explores basic mathematical methods to study dynamical systems, in discrete time and in continuous time. Such systems are prevalent in macroeconomics. The course introduces three methods, which can be covered in about a week:

1. Dynamic programming – To solve discrete-time optimization problems
2. Optimal control – To solve continuous-time optimization problems
3. Differential equations – To characterize continuous-time systems

## Source files

The source files are in LaTeX format. They are organized in 2 folders:

+ `lecturenotes` folder – 3 sets of lecture notes
+ `problemsets` folder – 4 problem sets

The folders also contain the PDF files produced by compiling the LaTeX files with pdfTeX.

### Lecture notes

The `lecturenotes` folder contains the LaTeX source files to the lecture notes:

+ `notes1.tex`, `notes1.pdf` – Lecture notes on dynamic programming
+ `notes2.tex`, `notes2.pdf` – Lecture notes on optimal control
+ `notes3.tex`, `notes3.pdf` – Lecture notes on differential equations
+ `phasediagrams.key`, `phasediagrams.pdf` – Phase diagrams included in `notes3.tex`

### Problem sets

The `problemsets` folder contains the LaTeX source files to the problem sets:

+ `ps1.tex`, `ps1.pdf` – Problem set on dynamic programming
+ `ps2.tex`, `ps2.pdf` – Problem set on optimal control
+ `ps3.tex`, `ps3.pdf` – Problem set on differential equations
+ `ps4.tex`, `ps4.pdf` – Cumulative problem set covering all three topics

Solutions to the problems sets are available to instructors [upon request](mailto:pascal.michaillat@gmail.com).

### Style files

The folders also contain the LaTeX style files that are used to format the lecture notes and problem sets:

+ `paper.sty` – [Commands to format academic papers](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-paper) 
+ `notes.sty` – Slight modification of `paper.sty` for teaching material
+ `math.sty` – [Commands to write math](https://github.com/pmichaillat/latex-math)
